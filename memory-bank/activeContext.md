# Active Context: Juspay Design System

## Current Focus

The current development focus is on building out the core component library and establishing the foundational architecture for the Juspay Design System. We are working on implementing components according to the design specifications and ensuring they follow the established patterns and guidelines.

## Recent Changes

- Set up the project structure with React, TypeScript, and Vite
- Configured TailwindCSS for styling
- Integrated Storybook for component documentation
- Established component patterns and guidelines
- Published initial version to npm (@vinitjuspay/design-system)

## Active Decisions

1. **Component Structure**: Components follow a consistent structure with separate files for types, utils, and the main component implementation
2. **Styling Approach**: Using TailwindCSS for styling with a centralized theme configuration
3. **Accessibility**: All components must meet accessibility standards
4. **Documentation**: All components must have Storybook documentation

## Current Challenges

1. **Component Consistency**: Ensuring all components follow the established patterns and guidelines
2. **Type Safety**: Maintaining strict TypeScript typing while keeping components flexible
3. **Bundle Size**: Optimizing the bundle size for performance
4. **Testing Strategy**: Establishing a testing strategy for components

## Next Steps

1. **Component Development**: Continue building out the core component library
   - Implement remaining basic components
   - Develop complex components (data tables, date pickers, etc.)
   - Add support for theming and customization
2. **Documentation**: Improve component documentation
   - Add usage examples
   - Document best practices
   - Create integration guides
3. **Testing**: Implement testing strategy
   - Unit tests for components
   - Visual regression tests
   - Accessibility tests
4. **Performance Optimization**: Optimize components for performance
   - Reduce bundle size
   - Improve rendering performance
   - Implement code splitting

## Open Questions

1. How should we handle component versioning and backwards compatibility?
2. What level of customization should we allow in the theming system?
3. How do we balance flexibility and consistency in component APIs?
4. What metrics should we use to evaluate the success of the design system?
